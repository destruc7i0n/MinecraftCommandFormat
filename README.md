# Sublime Minecraft Command Formatter
A Sublime Text Plugin to Format Minecraft Commands

## Installation

Install this sublime text 2/3 package via [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net) search for package: "**SublimeMinecraftCommandFormat**" 

<sup>(How-To here: https://packagecontrol.io/installation , message me if needed more info)</sup>

#### or manually install

- `cd <Packages directory>`
- `git clone https://github.com/destruc7i0n/SublimeMinecraftCommandFormat.git`

##### If you do not have git or Package Control
- Download [me](https://github.com/destruc7i0n/SublimeMinecraftCommandFormat/archive/master.zip) and extract.
- Place the folder inside that one into `<Packages directory>`. (At the `Preferences > Browse Packages...` menu item in Sublime Text 2 to get into Packages folder!)

## Usage

To prettify your command, make selection of the command (or else it will try to use full view buffer) and go to the Command Palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>. Find "Minecraft Format: Format (Pretty Print) Minecraft Command" (you can search for part of it like 'minecraft format')

### Compress / Minify JSON

Using Command Palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> find "Minecraft Format: Minify (compress) Minecraft Command" (you can search for part of it like 'minecraft minify'). This convert the whole document or your selection as one line command which later you can use in your command blocks.
