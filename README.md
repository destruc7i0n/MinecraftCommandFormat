# Sublime Minecraft Command Formatter
A Sublime Text Plugin to Format Minecraft Commands

## Installation

- `cd <Packages directory>`
- `git clone https://github.com/destruc7i0n/SublimeMinecraftCommandFormat.git`

##### If you do not have git
- Download [me](https://github.com/destruc7i0n/SublimeMinecraftCommandFormat/archive/master.zip)
- Place the folder inside that one into `<Packages directory>` (See how to find that directory [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13124532/installing-packages-in-sublime-text-2))

## Usage

To prettify your command, make selection of the command (or else it will try to use full view buffer) and go to the Command Palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd>. Find "Minecraft Format: Format (Pretty Print) Minecraft Command" (you can search for part of it like 'minecraft format')

### Compress / Minify JSON

Using Command Palette <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> find "Minecraft Format: Minify (compress) Minecraft Command" (you can search for part of it like 'minecraft minify'). This convert the whole document or your selection as one line command which later you can use in your command blocks.
